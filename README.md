## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Built with Django, a Python framework.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Javascript, leveraging Bootstrap Design Libraries
- **Database**: POSTGRESQL hosted on SUPABASE

## Getting Started

To begin using ProjectTracker, simply navigate to the homepage and create an account. Once logged in, you'll have access to all the project management tools at your fingertips.


## Wireframes
### Design Wireframes:
* Create wireframes for the main pages of the application (registration, login, dashboard, project management, task management) to guide the frontend development.

## Models
1. **User:** Stores user information and authentication details.
2. **Profile:** Stores additional user information like bio, profile picture.
3. **Project:** Stores details of projects, including title, description, state, and timestamps.
4. **Task:** Stores details of tasks, including title, description, due date, status, and associated project.
5. **Comment:** (Optional) Stores comments on projects or tasks.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django for API development and user authentication.
- **Frontend:** Plain JavaScript and Bootstrap for the user interface.

## Implementation Outline

### Backend (Django)
1. **Set Up Django Project:**
   - Initialize a new Django project and configure the settings, including the connection to the Supabase database.
2. **Create User Model and Authentication Endpoints:**
   - Implement the user model and endpoints for user registration, login, and profile management using Django REST Framework.
3. **Develop Project Model and Endpoints:**
   - Create the project model with fields for title, description, and state. Implement CRUD endpoints for managing projects.
4. **Develop Task Model and Endpoints:**
   - Create the task model with fields for title, description, due date, status, and associated project. Implement CRUD endpoints for managing tasks.
5. **Develop Comment Model and Endpoints (Optional):**
   - Create a comment model for adding comments to projects or tasks. Implement CRUD endpoints for managing comments.
6. **Test Backend with Postman:**
   - Use Postman to test all API endpoints for user, project, task, and comment management to ensure they function correctly.

### Frontend (Plain JS + Bootstrap)
1. **Set Up Frontend Project:**
   - Initialize a new frontend project using plain JavaScript and configure Bootstrap for styling.
2. **Develop Registration and Login Pages:**
    - Create the registration and login pages with forms for user input and connect them to the backend authentication endpoints.
3. **Develop Dashboard Page:**
    - Implement the dashboard page to display the user's projects, with options to add, edit, delete, and view tasks.
4. **Develop Project Management:**
    - Create forms and functionality to add, edit, and delete projects, and update the project state.
5. **Develop Task Management:**
    - Create forms and functionality to add, edit, and delete tasks within projects.
6. **Implement State Management:**
    - Ensure that projects can transition between draft, ongoing, completed, and cancelled states through the frontend interface.
7. **Integrate Comments (Optional):**
    - Add functionality to view, add, edit, and delete comments on projects and tasks.

### Database and Hosting
1. **Configure Supabase Database:**
    - Set up the Supabase database, create necessary tables and configure Django to connect to it.
2. **Deploy Backend to Heroku:**
    - Deploy the Django backend to Heroku, ensuring that all environment variables and configurations are set up correctly.
3. **Deploy Frontend to Heroku:**
    - Deploy the frontend to Heroku and configure it to communicate with the backend.
4. **Set Up Content Delivery Network (CDN) (Optional):**
    - Consider using a CDN like Cloudinary for storing and serving images to ensure faster load times and handle Herokuâ€™s sleep mode limitations.

### Testing and Optimization
1. **End-to-End Testing:**
    - Perform end-to-end testing of the entire application to ensure all components work together seamlessly.
2. **Optimize Performance:**
    - Optimize the performance of the frontend and backend, ensuring quick load times and efficient API calls.
3. **Prepare for Launch:**
    - Finalize all features, ensure all documentation is complete, and prepare the application for launch.

### User Stories

## Site Users
* As a new user, I'll be informed about the benefits of using the webpage/webapp before signing up.

### Local Development Setup

#### Mac + GitPod (VS Code) 

If it's the first time you run python on your machine, a newer version might be needed. Check version of python and pip inside terminal.
For GitPod you might skip the creation of the virtual environment.
```bash
$ python --version
$ pip --version
```
Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone <repository-url>
```
Change into the project directory:
```bash
$ cd ProjectTracker
```
Install the necesarry requirements listed above
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the development server: (Skip if database is not set up), the development server can be shut down pushing [CTRL + C] inside the terminal.
```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```
The environment variables are needed to be set in a .env file in you root directory
```bash
touch .env
```
Depending if the database is already set up, if not run migrations, this way the attached database will be configured by the models provided in this porject.
```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py 
```
Creating a superuser might be important for debugging issues.
```bash
$ py manage.py createsuperuser
```
Access the application with the link provided in the terminal:

FINAL STEP: Run the development server:
```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

e.g. [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

#### Windows deployment

For windows deployment the above instruction can be used once wsl2 with vscode is up and running.

### Deployment on Heroku

1. Create a Heroku Account:
   
   If you don't have a Heroku account, sign up at Heroku.
2. Install Heroku CLI:
    
    Download and install the Heroku CLI.
3. Login to Heroku:
   
    Open your terminal and log in to your Heroku account using the command heroku login.
4. Create a New Heroku App:
   
   Navigate to your project directory and create a new Heroku app using the command heroku create.
5. Check the Procfile:
   
   Ensure that the Procfile in your project directory contains the following line:
    
        release: python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
        web: gunicorn project_tracker.wsgi
6. Set Environment Variables
    
    Configure the necessary environment variables as Config Vars in the Heroku settings. This can be done via the Heroku dashboard under the "Settings" tab or using the Heroku CLI with commands like heroku config:set.
7. Install Dependencies:
    
    Ensure all dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. Heroku will automatically install these dependencies.
8. Configure the Database:
    
    Add the PostgreSQL add-on to your Heroku app. This can be done via the Heroku dashboard or using the command 
    
        heroku addons:create 
        heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev.
9. Run Migrations:
    
    Run the database migrations on Heroku to set up the database schema.

10. Create a Superuser (Optional):

    Create a superuser for admin access.
11. Deploy the Code:
    
    Push your code to the Heroku remote repository using git push heroku main.
12. Open the Application:
    
    Open your deployed application using the command 
        
        heroku open
